# ReefGen
A Processing sketch that uses diffusion model generated damselfish and coral reefs to explore the connection between data visualization and machine learning generative art.

TO-DO: The texture maps for the damselfish are generatively created but still require formatting by hand in Photoshop. Eventually, the fish texture maps will be created and properly formatted at run time and those damselfish will only exist for that unique run. Same with the reef. 

The reef's appearance - healthy to unhealthy -  will also be generated in real time via access to real world data sources, and the number  and species of damselfish will adjust accordingly. Eventually, again, more individual species of coral and other reef inhabitants will be added.
